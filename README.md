# Behavior-Cloning-AV
This project improves trust in autonomous vehicles (AVs) by narrowing the gap between human and AV behavior using behavior cloning (BC). Data collected via CARLA simulator includes RGB images, LiDAR, and numerical inputs. A multi-modal neural network predicts steering, throttle, and brake, showing promising results in urban and work zone scenarios.
